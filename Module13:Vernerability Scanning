1. Introduction to Vulnerability Scanning

Vulnerability scanning is the process of identifying security weaknesses in systems, networks, and applications. These weaknesses (vulnerabilities) can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access, steal data, or disrupt services.

Vulnerability scanning is a proactive security measure used by organizations to find and fix issues before attackers do.

2. Purpose of Vulnerability Scanning

Vulnerability scanning helps to:

Identify security flaws

Reduce attack surface

Improve system security posture

Support compliance requirements

Prevent data breaches

3. What is a Vulnerability

A vulnerability is a weakness in:

Software

Hardware

Network configuration

Security policy

Examples:

Outdated software

Weak passwords

Open ports

Misconfigured servers

4. Vulnerability Scanning vs Penetration Testing
Vulnerability Scanning	Penetration Testing
Identifies vulnerabilities	Exploits vulnerabilities
Automated process	Manual + automated
Lower risk	Higher risk
Regular activity	Periodic assessment
5. Types of Vulnerability Scanning
5.1 Network Vulnerability Scanning

Scans network devices

Finds open ports and services

Example: Nmap, Nessus

5.2 Host-Based Scanning

Scans individual systems

Checks OS-level vulnerabilities

Example: OpenVAS

5.3 Web Application Scanning

Identifies web vulnerabilities

Finds OWASP Top 10 issues

Example: Nikto, Burp Suite

5.4 Database Vulnerability Scanning

Identifies database misconfigurations

Example: SQL-specific scanners

6. Vulnerability Scanning Process

Asset identification

Scan configuration

Vulnerability detection

Risk assessment

Reporting

Remediation

Re-scanning

7. Vulnerability Severity Levels

Vulnerabilities are categorized using CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System):

Low (0.1 – 3.9)

Medium (4.0 – 6.9)

High (7.0 – 8.9)

Critical (9.0 – 10.0)

8. Common Vulnerabilities

SQL Injection

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Outdated software

Open ports

Weak authentication

Misconfigurations

9. Popular Vulnerability Scanning Tools
9.1 Nessus

Commercial tool

Comprehensive scanning

Detailed reports

9.2 OpenVAS (Greenbone)

Open-source

Network vulnerability scanning

Regular updates

9.3 Nmap (NSE Scripts)

Basic vulnerability detection

Lightweight scanning

9.4 Nikto

Web server vulnerability scanner

Finds dangerous files and configs

9.5 Burp Suite

Web application scanning

Manual + automated testing

10. Basic Vulnerability Scan Example (Nmap)
nmap --script vuln target


Runs vulnerability detection scripts

Identifies common weaknesses

11. Vulnerability Scan Example (Nikto)
nikto -h http://example.com


Scans web server for known vulnerabilities

12. Advantages of Vulnerability Scanning

Early detection of weaknesses

Improves security posture

Cost-effective

Supports compliance (ISO, PCI-DSS)

13. Limitations of Vulnerability Scanning

False positives

Cannot confirm exploitability

Needs regular updates

Limited context awareness

14. Ethical and Legal Considerations

Vulnerability scanning must be performed:

With proper authorization

On owned or permitted systems

In compliance with laws and policies

Unauthorized scanning is illegal.

15. Role of Vulnerability Scanning in SOC

SOC teams use vulnerability scanning to:

Monitor security posture

Prioritize risks

Support incident response

Assist patch management

16. Real-World Example

An organization performs a weekly vulnerability scan and discovers:

Outdated Apache version

High CVSS vulnerability

The issue is patched before attackers can exploit it.

17. Conclusion

Vulnerability scanning is a fundamental cybersecurity practice that helps organizations identify and manage security risks. When combined with patching, monitoring, and penetration testing, it significantly reduces the likelihood of successful cyber attacks.
