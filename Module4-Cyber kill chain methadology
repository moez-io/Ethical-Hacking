1. Introduction to Cyber Kill Chain

The Cyber Kill Chain is a cybersecurity framework developed by Lockheed Martin to describe the stages of a cyber attack. It helps security professionals understand how attacks happen and where they can be detected, prevented, or mitigated.

By breaking an attack into steps, defenders can stop attacks at early stages instead of reacting after damage occurs.

2. Purpose of Cyber Kill Chain

The Cyber Kill Chain helps to:

Understand attacker behavior

Identify attack stages

Improve detection and response

Strengthen defensive strategies

Reduce attack impact

3. Overview of Cyber Kill Chain Phases

The Cyber Kill Chain consists of 7 phases:

Reconnaissance

Weaponization

Delivery

Exploitation

Installation

Command and Control (C2)

Actions on Objectives

4. Phase 1: Reconnaissance

In this phase, attackers gather information about the target.

Attacker Activities

IP address discovery

DNS enumeration

Email harvesting

Employee profiling

Network scanning

Defensive Controls

Network monitoring

Limiting public information

IDS/IPS

Security awareness training

5. Phase 2: Weaponization

The attacker creates a malicious payload by combining:

Exploit code

Malware (virus, trojan, ransomware)

Examples

Malware embedded in PDF or Word file

Backdoor attached to an exploit

Defensive Controls

Endpoint protection

Malware analysis

Application whitelisting

6. Phase 3: Delivery

The attacker delivers the weapon to the target.

Common Delivery Methods

Phishing emails

Malicious websites

USB devices

Drive-by downloads

Defensive Controls

Email security gateways

Web filters

USB control policies

7. Phase 4: Exploitation

The exploit is triggered to take advantage of a vulnerability.

Examples

Browser vulnerability exploitation

Office macro execution

OS privilege escalation

Defensive Controls

Patch management

Vulnerability scanning

Exploit prevention systems

8. Phase 5: Installation

Malware installs itself on the victim system.

Examples

Backdoor installation

Rootkit deployment

Persistence mechanisms

Defensive Controls

Antivirus

EDR solutions

File integrity monitoring

9. Phase 6: Command and Control (C2)

The infected system communicates with the attacker’s server.

Purpose

Receive commands

Exfiltrate data

Download additional malware

Defensive Controls

Firewall rules

DNS monitoring

Network traffic analysis

10. Phase 7: Actions on Objectives

The attacker achieves their goal.

Possible Objectives

Data theft

System destruction

Ransomware deployment

Espionage

Defensive Controls

Data loss prevention (DLP)

Incident response plans

Backup and recovery

11. Example of Cyber Kill Chain Attack

Phishing Attack Example:

Recon: Collect employee emails

Weaponization: Create malicious PDF

Delivery: Send phishing email

Exploitation: User opens file

Installation: Malware installs

C2: Connects to attacker server

Action: Data exfiltration

12. Advantages of Cyber Kill Chain

Clear attack visibility

Helps proactive defense

Improves incident response

Useful for SOC operations

13. Limitations of Cyber Kill Chain

Focuses mainly on external attacks

Less effective against insider threats

Linear model (real attacks may not be linear)

14. Cyber Kill Chain vs MITRE ATT&CK
Cyber Kill Chain	MITRE ATT&CK
Linear model	Matrix-based
High-level stages	Detailed techniques
Attack lifecycle	Tactics & techniques
15. Ethical Considerations

Understanding the Cyber Kill Chain is for:

Defensive security

Threat hunting

Risk mitigation

It should never be used for illegal hacking activities.

16. Conclusion

The Cyber Kill Chain provides a structured approach to understanding cyber attacks. By detecting and stopping threats at early stages, organizations can significantly reduce the risk and impact of cyber incidents.
