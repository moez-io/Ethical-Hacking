1. Introduction to Nmap

Nmap (Network Mapper) is a powerful open-source tool used for network discovery, port scanning, and security auditing. It helps security professionals identify live hosts, open ports, running services, operating systems, and potential vulnerabilities in a network.

Nmap is widely used by:

Penetration testers

Network administrators

SOC analysts

Ethical hackers

2. Why Nmap Is Important

Nmap is important because it:

Identifies active devices on a network

Detects open and closed ports

Reveals running services and versions

Helps find security misconfigurations

Assists in vulnerability assessment

3. How Nmap Works

Nmap works by sending specially crafted packets to target systems and analyzing the responses. Based on the replies (or lack of replies), Nmap determines:

Host availability

Port state (open, closed, filtered)

Service and version information

Operating system details

4. Common Nmap Terminology

Host Discovery – Finding live systems

Port Scanning – Checking open ports

Service Enumeration – Identifying services

Fingerprinting – Detecting OS and software

Scripts (NSE) – Automating security checks

5. Port States in Nmap

Open – Service is actively accepting connections

Closed – Port is reachable but no service is listening

Filtered – Firewall is blocking the scan

Unfiltered – Port is accessible but state unknown

Open|Filtered – Cannot determine exact state

6. Types of Nmap Scans
6.1 TCP Connect Scan
nmap -sT target


Completes full TCP handshake

Reliable but easily detected

6.2 SYN Scan (Stealth Scan)
nmap -sS target


Half-open scan

Faster and stealthier

Requires root privileges

6.3 UDP Scan
nmap -sU target


Scans UDP services

Slower but important

6.4 FIN Scan
nmap -sF target


Bypasses some firewalls

Works on Unix systems

6.5 Ping Scan (Host Discovery)
nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24


Finds live hosts only

No port scanning

7. Service and Version Detection
nmap -sV target


Detects service name and version

Helps identify vulnerable software

8. Operating System Detection
nmap -O target


Detects target OS

Uses TCP/IP fingerprinting

9. Aggressive Scan
nmap -A target


Includes:

OS detection

Version detection

Script scanning

Traceroute

10. Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE)

NSE allows automation of advanced scanning tasks.

Script Categories

auth

brute

discovery

exploit

malware

vuln

Example: Vulnerability Scan
nmap --script vuln target

11. Firewall & IDS Evasion Techniques

Fragment packets

nmap -f target


Spoof source IP

nmap -S fakeIP target


Decoy scanning

nmap -D RND:10 target

12. Output Formats
nmap -oN output.txt target
nmap -oX output.xml target
nmap -oA scan_results target


Normal

XML

Grepable

All formats

13. Nmap Use Cases

Network inventory

Security auditing

Vulnerability assessment

Penetration testing

Compliance checking

14. Advantages of Nmap

Free and open source

Highly customizable

Large script library

Cross-platform support

15. Limitations of Nmap

Can be detected by IDS/IPS

Requires experience for accurate results

Slow scans on large networks

16. Ethical and Legal Considerations

Nmap should only be used on:

Systems you own

Networks you manage

Targets with written permission

Unauthorized scanning is illegal and unethical.

17. Conclusion

Nmap is one of the most essential tools in cybersecurity. It provides deep visibility into networks and systems, helping professionals identify weaknesses before attackers do. Mastering Nmap is a core skill for ethical hackers and security engineers.
