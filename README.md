# Ethical-Hacking
This repository contains an Ethical Hacking course with 30 modules covering the complete hacking lifecycle. Topics include Kali Linux, reconnaissance, scanning, vulnerability analysis, exploitation, web attacks, password cracking, social engineering, anonymity, and post-exploitation. Built for beginners learning ethical cybersecurity skills.
Introduction to Ethical Hacking (30 Modules Overview)

Ethical Hacking is the legal and authorized practice of testing systems, networks, and websites to identify security weaknesses before malicious hackers exploit them. Ethical hackers use the same techniques as attackers—but with permission and responsibility—to help organizations protect their digital assets.

In this course, you will learn Ethical Hacking through 30 well-structured modules, starting from absolute basics and moving toward advanced real-world attack techniques. Each module is designed to build your skills step by step, helping you understand how hackers think, plan, attack, and maintain access, while also learning how these attacks can be prevented.

The 30 modules cover the complete ethical hacking lifecycle, including:

Foundations of ethical hacking and Kali Linux

Reconnaissance techniques (Google dorking, WHOIS, DNS, social media recon)

Target analysis (technology detection, subdomains, WAF identification)

Scanning and enumeration using tools like Nmap

Vulnerability scanning and exploit discovery

Exploitation using Metasploit and manual techniques

Web application attacks such as SQL Injection and XSS

Password attacks, hash dumping, and cracking

Social engineering and phishing concepts

Anonymity, port forwarding, and post-exploitation techniques

Each of the 30 modules focuses on a specific topic and includes both theory and practical understanding, allowing you to gradually move from beginner to confident ethical hacker. By completing all modules, you will gain a strong foundation for bug bounty, penetration testing, and cybersecurity careers, while always following ethical and legal guidelines.
