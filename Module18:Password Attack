1. Introduction to Password Attacks

Password attacks are techniques used to obtain or crack user passwords to gain unauthorized access to systems, networks, or applications. Since passwords are still widely used for authentication, they are a primary target for attackers.

Understanding password attacks helps security professionals detect, prevent, and defend against them.

2. Why Password Attacks Are Effective

Password attacks succeed because of:

Weak passwords

Reused passwords

Lack of multi-factor authentication (MFA)

Poor password policies

User awareness issues

3. Types of Password Attacks
3.1 Brute Force Attack

Tries all possible combinations of passwords until the correct one is found.

Characteristics:

Very slow

Guaranteed success if no protection

Easily detected

3.2 Dictionary Attack

Uses a predefined wordlist instead of all combinations.

Examples:

Common passwords

Leaked password lists

3.3 Hybrid Attack

Combination of:

Dictionary words

Numbers and symbols

Example:

password123
admin@2024

3.4 Credential Stuffing

Uses leaked username–password pairs from data breaches on other platforms.

Reason it works: Password reuse.

3.5 Password Spraying

Tries one common password across many accounts.

Example:

Company@123
Welcome@1


Harder to detect than brute force.

3.6 Rainbow Table Attack

Uses precomputed hash tables to crack hashed passwords quickly.

Works only if:

No salt is used

Weak hashing algorithms exist

3.7 Keylogging

Malicious software records keystrokes to capture passwords.

4. Online vs Offline Password Attacks
Online Attacks	Offline Attacks
Performed over network	Performed on stolen hashes
Slower	Faster
Easily detected	Harder to detect
Limited attempts	Unlimited attempts
5. Tools Commonly Used for Password Attacks

⚠️ For educational/lab use only

Hydra – Online brute force

Medusa – Network login attacks

John the Ripper – Password cracking

Hashcat – Fast hash cracking

Metasploit – Credential attacks

6. Example: Password Attack Workflow (High Level)

Identify login service

Enumerate usernames

Choose attack type

Use wordlist

Attempt authentication

Gain access or report weakness

7. Common Targets of Password Attacks

SSH

FTP

Web login forms

RDP

Email accounts

Wi-Fi networks

8. Password Hashing Concepts

Passwords are stored as hashes, not plaintext.

Common Hash Algorithms

MD5 (weak)

SHA-1 (weak)

SHA-256

bcrypt

scrypt

Argon2

9. Why Salting Is Important

Salt is random data added to passwords before hashing.

Benefits:

Prevents rainbow table attacks

Makes hash cracking harder

Increases security

10. Signs of Password Attacks

Multiple failed login attempts

Login attempts from unusual IPs

Account lockouts

Suspicious authentication logs

11. Prevention Techniques
11.1 Strong Password Policies

Minimum length

Complexity rules

No password reuse

11.2 Account Lockout Policies

Lock after multiple failures

Time-based delays

11.3 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

OTP

Authenticator apps

Biometrics

11.4 Monitoring and Logging

SIEM alerts

Authentication logs

12. Role of Password Attacks in Penetration Testing

In ethical hacking, password attacks are used to:

Test password strength

Identify policy weaknesses

Improve authentication security

13. Ethical and Legal Considerations

Password attacks must only be performed:

With written authorization

In lab or test environments

For defensive security assessments

Unauthorized password attacks are illegal.

A password spraying attack using Welcome@123 compromises multiple accounts.

Lesson: Strong passwords + MFA are critical.

15. Advantages of Understanding Password Attacks

Better defense planning

Improved security policies

Reduced breach risk

Stronger authentication systems

16. Limitations of Password Attacks

Time-consuming

Increasingly blocked by MFA

Easily detected with proper monitoring
